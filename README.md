Media companies often visualize their website news stories in HTML. This iOS project organizes such HTML in a UICollectionView, with each cell as a WebView sized based off the dimensions of the embedded HTML.

Utilizes ScrollView to allow user to scroll horizontally across UIViewControllers holding different categories of News Media, with mockup NavigationView and TabBarController

Uses news snippets from the [Morning Brew](https://www.morningbrew.com/) as sample data.
